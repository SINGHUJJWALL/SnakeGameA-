## About

This project is a Snake game where the snake's movement is determined by the A* algorithm, ensuring efficient navigation towards the food while avoiding obstacles. The game is built using Python and utilizes libraries such as Pygame for game development. Additionally, it incorporates reinforcement learning for training the snake to make optimal decisions.

## Installation

To get the game up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game-a-star.git
Change to the project directory:
bash
Copy
cd snake-game-a-star
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy
pip install pygame numpy torch matplotlib
Usage
To play the game, simply run the main script:
bash
Copy
python main.py
Algorithm
The game utilizes the A* algorithm for pathfinding. Here's a brief overview of how it works:
Start Node: The snake's current position.
Goal Node: The position of the food.
Heuristic Function: Uses the Manhattan distance to estimate the cost from the current position to the goal.
Path Calculation: The algorithm finds the least-cost path from the start to the goal, considering both the cost of the path from the start to the current node and the heuristic cost to the goal.
Gameplay
Controls: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
Objective: Eat the food to grow the snake while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.
Reinforcement Learning: The snake's behavior is also influenced by a reinforcement learning model that trains the snake to make optimal decisions.
