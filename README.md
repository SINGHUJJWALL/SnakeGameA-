# Snake Game with A* Pathfinding AI

This project is a Snake game enhanced with an AI that uses the A* pathfinding algorithm to navigate efficiently. The AI calculates the optimal path to collect food while avoiding obstacles, making the game more strategic and autonomous.

## Features
- Classic Snake game mechanics
- AI-driven movement using the **A* algorithm**
- Real-time visualization of the AI's decision-making
- Smooth game controls and user interface

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Core logic)
- **Pygame** (Game rendering)
- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm** (AI navigation)
